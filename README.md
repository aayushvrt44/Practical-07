Array and 2D Array related Questions in C++:

Task-7.1 Create a switch statement [Manual], In Which:

  a. When you pass 1 your program would print current year
  b. When you pass 2 your program would print current month
  c. When you pass 3 your program would print current day
  d. When you pass 4 your program would print Not applicable



Task-7.2 Create a switch statement [Using ctime], In Which:

  a. When you pass 1 your program would print current year
  b. When you pass 2 your program would print current month
  c. When you pass 3 your program would print current day
  d. When you pass 4 your program would print Not applicable



Task-7.3

  v1. Print using reverse method:

  1 2 3 		    9 8 7

  4 5 6  ==>    6 5 4

  7 8 9         3 2 1

   

  v2. Print using (10- arr[i][j])  method:

  1 2 3 		    9 8 7

  4 5 6  ==>    6 5 4

  7 8 9         3 2 1

  

  v3. Restore using reverse method [without creating new array]:

  1 2 3 		    9 8 7

  4 5 6  ==>    6 5 4

  7 8 9         3 2 1

  

  v4. Restore using (10- arr[i][j]) method [without creating new array]:

  1 2 3 		    9 8 7

  4 5 6  ==>    6 5 4

  7 8 9         3 2 1



Task-7.4 Restore the same values in the same array, arr[3][3]:

	  1 2 3		    1 1 1

    4 5 6   ==> 2 2 2

	  7 8 9		    3 3 3  

  v1. Use row loop [int i, for all j]

  v2. Use arr[i][N-1]/3, at each place

  v3. Use, arr[i][j]-(2*i+j)
